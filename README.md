### The Magic Wand

This is the code for my fianl project in [MAS.S65: Indistinguishable Fromâ€¦ Magic as Interface, Technology, and Tradition](http://indistinguishablefrom.media.mit.edu/) I took in MIT Media Lab in spring 2016.  

More explenations about this project are in my [class documentation](http://jasrub.github.io/indistinguishableFrom-MAS.s65/final.html)

This is a Node.js server that connects to a [LightBlue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean) and reads it accelerometer values into a buffer.

With every move, a new action happens:
playing music from the computer speakers or turning on the nrf51UART connected lights.
